## Introduction

This project analyzes a digital experiment conducted by Vanguard to enhance user experience through a redesigned User Interface (UI) and contextual prompts. The objective was to determine if these changes would encourage more clients to complete their online processes.

## Project Context

Vanguard, a US-based investment management company, conducted an A/B test from 03/15/2017 to 06/20/2017. The experiment compared a control group using the traditional UI with a test group experiencing the new, intuitive UI. Both groups followed the same process sequence, from an initial page to a final confirmation page.

## Datasets Used
* Client Profiles (Demographic Data)
* Digital Footprints (Interaction Data)
* Experiment Roster (Group Assignment)


## Experiment Sample Characteristics

- **Age Distribution**: Most clients were in the age range of 30-60 years.
- **Gender Distribution**: The sample included a balanced distribution of genders.
- **Client Count**: The experiment included a significant number of clients in both the control and test groups, ensuring robust results.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Completion Rate**: Percentage of clients who completed the entire process.
2. **Time Spent on Each Step**: Average time clients spent on each step.
3. **Error Rates**: Frequency of errors encountered by clients at each step.
4. **Additional KPIs**: Client satisfaction scores, number of revisits, and drop-off rates.

## Analysis and Findings

### Univariate Analysis
- **Age Distribution**: Most clients were in the age range of 30-60 years.
- **Tenure Distribution**: Clients had a wide range of tenures, with many having long-standing relationships with Vanguard.
- **Balance Distribution**: Balances varied widely, indicating diverse financial backgrounds.
- **Logins and Calls**: Clients showed varying levels of interaction with Vanguard's online platform.

### Bivariate Analysis
- **Age vs. Balance**: Older clients tended to have higher balances.
- **Tenure vs. Balance**: Longer tenure was associated with higher balances.
- **Gender vs. Balance**: There were differences in balances between different gender groups.

3. ** Males confirm more often than females in both the test and control groups.**

4. **The new website improves user efficiency by reducing time spent on each step.**

5. **The new website increases the number of logins.** 

## Conclusion

The analysis confirmed that Vanguard's new UI improves user experience and completion rates. Future improvements should focus on incorporating client feedback and gathering additional data to further enhance the UI.

## Recommendations

- **Continue Refining the UI**: Based on client feedback and additional data.
- **Further Experiments**: Conduct more experiments to test new features and improvements.
- **Data Collection**: Enhance data collection methods to gather more comprehensive insights.
